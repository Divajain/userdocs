## Collecting one-off payments
For simple one-off payments without an authorisation (that require payment details to be entered), simply create a payment record with the required amount, and select the payment route options you wish to allow on the payment page.
 
You can then access the payment page via one of two ways:
 
 - If the customer is providing you with payment details as you are in the org (such as over the phone), then hit the “Process payment” button on the top-right of the screen, then enter the required details into the form.
 - If you wish to provide the customer with a link to the payment page that they can complete at their own convenience, copy the “Ecommerce URL” field and supply this to the customer (this might be via email, IM, or any other means.)
 
## Manually collecting ad-hoc payments against an existing authorisation
 
Ad hoc payments can easily be taken where a related authorisation record is already set up.

1. Navigate to the authorisation record for which you wish to set up a payment. Under the payment related list for the authorisation, select `New`:
 
![New payment from auth](/userdocs/img/payments/payment_related_auth.png)
 
Note that the authorisation field will be pre-populated with the required authorisation record.

2. Enter the required amount, and then hit Save. This will create the payment record with the authorisation attached.

3. Navigate to the payment record, then hit the Process payment button.
 
## Automatically collecting payments against an existing authorisation
 
Payments can be automatically collected against an existing authorisation by creating a payment record where the following conditions are true:
 - The payment record is set to “Awaiting submission”
 - The payment record is attached to an authorisation
 - The attached authorisation's status is either “In force” or “Pending”
 
An overnight batch job will run and attempt to collect any payments that fulfil these above criteria.
 
This payment record can be created manually as above. However, more commonly in practice, it can also be created automatically as part of a Lightning flow, Process, Apex trigger or any other method Salesforce provides for automation.

## Collecting a payment and an authorisation simultaneously

Many business cases require collecting an initial payment from a customer, and simultaneously collecting an authoristaion so future payments can be collected seamlessly.

To do this:

 - Create a new payment record with the amount of the initial payment
 - Create a new authorisation record
 - Set the "Authorisation" field on the payment record to the authorisation created in the previous step
 - Hit the "Process payment" button to process the payment and authorisation from within Salesforce, or distribute the link contained in the "Ecommerce URL" to the customer for processing.
 
When the payment page has been filled in and processed, both the payment and authorisation record will be populated with the result of the transaction. The authorisation record can then be used to process any future payments as and when required.

## Expiring a payment link

You may wish to expire the payment link so it can no longer be used to collect funds. To do this, simply set the "Payment stage" field to "Expired":

![Expired status](/userdocs/img/payments/expired.png)
 
## Required data
 
The required fields for a payment are: 

 - Available payment routes
 - Amount 
 - Currency (only if multi-currency payments are enabled for the Salesforce org.)
 
When creating a payment from an authorisation, the authorisation field will automatically be populated with the correct record ID.
 
## Statuses
Payment statuses are provided as follows:
 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Awaiting submission</th>
<td>The payment has not yet been processed or submitted to your payment service provider.</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Submitted for collection</th>
<td>The payment has been submitted to your payment service provider, but the outcome of this transaction is not yet known. This is used for direct debit payments which will take a few days to clear.</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Collected from Customer</th>
<td>The payment has been collected from the customer and has been confirmed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Failed</th>
<td>The payment failed to collect. There are a variety of reasons why this could happen, in this case there should be a reason documented in the “Status description” field.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 
## Cancellations / Refunds in Salesforce
If you wish to refund a payment, navigate to the payment record and press the “Refund” button. This will show as a standard button in classic, and a quick action in lightning:
 
![Refund button](/userdocs/img/payments/refund_button.png)
 
You’ll then see the refund dialog, where you can either choose to refund a specified amount (up to the original amount of the payment).
 
![Refund dialog](/userdocs/img/payments/refund_dialog.png)
 
Note that some payment service providers place restrictions on refunds. If this is the case, you will need to contact your payment service provider and ask them to enable refunds on your account.

## Payment outcomes
Not all payments will succeed - they may fail for a variety of reasons, such as insufficient funds, a billing address that doesn't match, the card has been blocked, etc. Asperato will sanitise all error responses across payment service providers to one of a set of values. This enables you to easily automate different flows off the back of specific failure reasons, rather than failures in general.

The sanitised responses we currently support are listed here:

<table class="sanitisedResponses">

## Custom references

Some PSPs allow you to specify a custom reference attached to an payment. You can specify this by using the "Custom reference" field available on the payment object.

However, note that not all PSPs or PSP account types support custom references, and some often have restrictions on the maximum length of a reference. You should check your PSPs documentation for any rules around specifying custom references. Note that setting a custom reference where they are not supported, or setting an invalid custom reference may cause a transaction to fail.

## Post transaction endpoints
After a user has loaded the paypage, they may exit the payment page in three different scenarios - having successfully completed the transaction, having unsuccessfully completed the transaction, and having cancelled (not attempted) the transaction. Asperato can send the user to different URLs for each of these three separate scenarios.

These URLs can be set by changing the value of fields on the payment object - these fields are are `Success_Endpoint`, `Fail_endpoint`, and `Cancel_endpoint`, and control the URL where a user will be sent in these three scenarios. Note that the "cancel" link will only appear on the payment page if the `Cancel_endpoint` is set.
